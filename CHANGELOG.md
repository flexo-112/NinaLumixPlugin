# LumixCamera

## 1.3.0.0
- **Built-in LibRaw decoder (optional, off by default).** For N.I.N.A. 3.2 and earlier, whose
  DCRaw/FreeImage converters show the RW2 of newer bodies (GH7, S5 II, S9, G9 II ...) as noise
  (issue #1), the plugin can now decode the RW2 itself with a bundled LibRaw 0.22.2 (official
  libraw.org build, LGPL/CDDL) and hand N.I.N.A. a bayered frame with the pattern read from LibRaw.
  Enable **Use built-in LibRaw decoder** in the options. On any failure it falls back to N.I.N.A.'s
  converter. Not needed on N.I.N.A. 3.3+, which ships its own LibRaw.
- Sensor table: **DC-S9** corrected to its real 24 MP full-frame sensor (6000x4000, 5.94 um; was a
  bogus 8192x5464 / 2.1 um entry that skewed the FOV) and **DC-G9M2** to the GH7's 25 MP MFT sensor
  (5776x4336, 3 um; was a copy of the G9's).
- Build: the post-build copy to the local N.I.N.A. plugin folder only runs on Windows, so the project
  also builds on Linux/CI with `EnableWindowsTargeting`.

## 1.2.1.0
- **Colour live view.** The live-view JPEG from the camera is re-mosaiced into a synthetic RGGB
  Bayer frame and handed to N.I.N.A. as bayered, so its normal debayer step produces a colour
  preview instead of the previous 16-bit grayscale conversion.
- The **Prefer JPEG** capture fallback uses the same path, so JPEG captures are also shown in colour.
- Fixed the release workflow: package the renamed `LumixPlugin.dll` (the 1.2.0.0 build packaged the
  old assembly name and failed).

## 1.2.0.0
- Optional **LUMIX Tether extended mode**: when enabled in the plugin options the driver
  loads the DLL from a local install of Panasonic's free LUMIX Tether application (never
  bundled) to unlock features the public SDK does not expose.
- Extended mode enables **BULB / exposures beyond the 60 s public-SDK cap**, RAW/JPEG image-quality
  selection, battery information, and live camera-state reporting.
- **Sub-second and full-range shutter speeds**: exposures snap to the nearest supported speed so
  N.I.N.A.'s Flat Wizard converges (previously non-listed and sub-second times failed or stuck).
- **Camera mode** is read (including the C1-C3 custom presets); the driver warns — but never
  blocks — when the dial is not in a manual-capable mode.
- **Save destination** option: SD card, PC (cardless), or both.
- Real capture-completion event replaces the previous SD-card-file workaround; fixes the
  first-capture error.
- **Prefer JPEG** option: forces JPEG capture as a workaround for cameras whose RAW (.RW2)
  N.I.N.A. cannot decode (e.g. GH7).
- Standard (public-SDK) mode is unchanged and remains the default; the public DLL now deploys
  alongside the plugin assembly.
